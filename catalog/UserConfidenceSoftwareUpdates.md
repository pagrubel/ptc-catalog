## User Story

when we publish updates. 

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | There is poor communication about application updates which do not always include behavior or performance changes. Users are not able to easily return to a prior version of the application after an update. |
| 1 | Documentation of changes are updated as changes or features are implemented including changes in behavior. |
| 2 | A database of updates and changes has been implemented and is continually updated. |
| 3 | As changes are made to the code base, application performance changes are documented for the release notes. |
| 3 | All updates are implemented with features to easily restore prior version. |
| 4 | Release notes which include behavior and performance changes are prepared and advertised to users before each release. |
