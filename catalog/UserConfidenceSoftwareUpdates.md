so that the latest application release is used.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Communication for update notifications are poor and do not always include behavior or performance changes. Users are not aware of upcoming changes. Users are not able to easily return to a prior version of the application after an update. |
| 1 new |  A method for documenting application changes to a single location is put in place. These documented changes  (typically called *release notes*) are published prior to new application updates/releases.  |
| 2 new| As changes are made to the code base, application behavior and performance changes are documented for the release notes.
| 3 new| Procedures to test performance of changes have been implemented, and results are logged into a database. |
| 4 new|  Documentation about how to roll back to a previous version is part of the release notes. |
